<p>Get a permanent software developer job at a downtown milwaukee company with a solid business model that isn’t remote, co-workers aren’t remote, pays well, has a great team that values my abilities, isn’t degrading, and doesn’t cause anger, depression or anxiety in any way, and does not demoralize or sabotage my personal life and professional success.</p>

<p>I have many years of valuable professional expertise in front-end dev, ui/x, javascript es5/6, git, and am generally proficient in the modern landscape of full-stack development within a team environment. My extensive experience would be valuable in mentoring junior devs, distilling down complex ideas, and providing insight into project planning. Please take a look at my github and repl.it profiles for some examples of my coding skills. Thanks!</p>

<h2>Work History</h2>
<p>I started my professional career designing and evnetually implementing <em>hundreds</em> of website designs for many university departments in an agency-style setting. I was an advocate for user-centered, css-based, content-first design approaches for new projects.
<br/>MAY 2005 – JUN 2012</p>
<p>I was promoted to a role with greater impact on University marketing and public relations efforts with interactive promotional content, targeted landing pages, branded wordpress themes, and google analytics implementations. I was an advocate for user-centered design, brand consistency on the web, and instrumental to inspiring a culture of web analytics across campus.
<br/>JUL 2012 – OCT 2015</p>
<p>After leaving UWM, and a bit of soul-searching, I worked with various Milwaukee-area companies on short-term web projects while also updating my technical skills as a Full Stack Developer specializing in JavaScript.
<br/>NOV 2015 – MAR 2018</p>
